<p><font face=Tahoma color=ff5757><h3>Massive buildings, fast-paced development, and economic growth that flourishes as much as its greenery, the bustling metropolis of Singapore overflows with promising businesses, markets and trade. But what really thrives within the city is beyond what the eyes see. Made up of Chinese, Malay, Indian and various other ethnicities, cultural heritage is what makes Singapore, Singapore — a congregation of different cultures coexisting in one congenial space. Cultural heritage is an important part of a Singaporean’s identity. It is how one expresses their thoughts, beliefs and way of life. Like the way Theemithi, an approximately three-month long Hindu festival is celebrated.</h3>
